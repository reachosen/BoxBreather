Box Breath
Overview
Box Breath is a simple web-based application designed to guide users through the yoga-inspired technique of box breathing. This technique helps clear the mind, reduce stress, and prepare for activities like public speaking by calming the fight-or-flight response. The app features a visual box with a moving circle, phase instructions (Breathe In, Hold, Breathe Out, Hold), and a customizable timer for practice sessions.

This project is implemented as an HTML/CSS/JavaScript application embedded in a Google Colab notebook, making it easy to test and modify in a cloud-based environment.

Timer: Selectable session durations (1, 2, or 5 minutes) with a countdown display.

Purpose: Ideal for daily mindfulness or pre-speaking preparation.
